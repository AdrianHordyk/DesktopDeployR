# DesktopDeployR
A framework for deploying self-contained R-based applications to the desktop

Meets the need to share R based applications without:
* training end users to use R
* setting up a centralized web-application server

General Application Structure
-----------------------------
```
/<appname>					# - application deployment root
./app/						# - application working directory

	./library/				# - application specific package library
	
	./shiny/				# - application framework folder (in this case, shiny)
		./global.R			# - global constants and functions for shiny-app
		./server.R			# - server processing function for shiny-app
		./ui.R				# - user interface definition function for shiny-app
	
	./app.R					# - application launch entry script
	./config.cfg			# - application configuration file
	./...					# - other application files
	
./dist/						# - application launch framework
	./R-Portable/			# - "vanilla" R interpreter
	./script/
		./R
			./run.R			# - R environment initialization and application launch
		./wsf
			./js
				./json2.js	# - JSON parsing library for Win Script Host
				./run.js	# - OS application launch script
			./run.wsf		# - merges javascript dependencies and launch script
	./USAGE.txt				# - notes on how the dist folder is structured

/<appname>.bat				# - batch file to start application
/README.txt					# - brief description of application
```

Untracked
---------
Due to their potentially large sizes, it is not recommended that the following 
folders be tracked by version control
* /app/library/
* /dist/

To handle the initial creation of the above:
* /app/library/ is generated by installing packages listed in '/app/config.cfg'
  in the `init_packages` field via standard R or devtools mechanisms targeting 
  "/app/library/" as the library location.
  
* the /dist/ directory is copied from a common /dist/.

Deployment
----------
The entiry folder structure is copied to the deployed location.
Optionally, the `.git` repository folder is removed from the deployment.
